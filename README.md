# Classification-of-Textual-Data
### Abstract
A key element in machine learning is the ability to predict outcomes with the highest accuracy possible.
In this project, we investigated the performance of two machine learning models —Multinomial Naive
Bayes and Softmax Regression— on two benchmark datasets —20 News groups and Sentiment140 —.
During the experiments, we conducted hyperparameter tuning of our models on the two datasets with
the aid of 5-fold cross validation to evaluate the performance of our models using accuracy. In addition,
we evaluated the effects that different sizes of training sets have on our models’ accuracy. In the end,
we found that the Multinomial Naive Bayes model performed better for the 20 News groups dataset,
while the Softmax Regression model performed better for the Sentiment140 dataset. Overall, the best
performing model was the Softmax Regression model.

This project was conducted in a group of 3 during the COMP 551 class at McGill University.
